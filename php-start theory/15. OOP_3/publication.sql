But many do.\r\n\r\nNo stone unturned\r\nUnder President Trump, the Department of Commerce has begun 122 investigations into anti-dumping/countervailing duties.\r\n\r\nThese tariffs have targeted all corners of the globe, reaching 31 countries total and affecting some $12bn (Â£9.4bn) in imports.\r\n\r\nChina has borne the brunt of US scrutiny, with about 40% of countervailing/antidumping investigations targeting Chinese products ranging from aluminium alloy to rubber bands to silk ribbons.\r\n\r\nOther countries have found themselves in Mr Trump\'s crosshairs as well.', 'Andrey', '/images/4.png', 'NewsPublication'),

Traditionally, children have cared for their ageing parents. But in the past decade, the number of elderly Indians who willingly or unwillingly spend the last few years of their lives in care homes has gone up.\r\n\r\n"What will I do if I go back home?
